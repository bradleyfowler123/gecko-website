			  <h2>Definition of Terms</h2>
				<p><b>Gecko</b> - Refering to us and all our products and services including mobile apps and website.</p>
				<p><b>You</b> - The person or entity using our services.</p>

			  <h2>What data we need</h2>
					<p>The personal data we collect from you includes:</p>
					<ul>
						 <li>questions, queries or feedback you leave, including your email address if you contact Gecko</li>
						 <li>your email address and subscription preferences when you sign up to our email alerts</li>
						 <li>Any data such as Agenda items, interests, etc you enter into the app</li>
						 <li>Your Facebook friends user ids, so we can show you what their up to you in your feed</li>
						 <li>your Internet Protocol (IP) address, and details of which version of web browser you used</li>
						 <li>information on how you use the site, using cookies and page tagging techniques</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The legal basis for processing this data is to provide a service to users, as set out in law which is statute based.</p>

			  <h2>Why we need it</h2>
					<p>We use Google Analytics software to collect information about how you use Gecko. We do this to help make sure the site is meeting the needs of its users and to help us make improvements, for example improving site search. Google Analytics stores information about:</p>
					<ul>
						 <li>the pages you visit on Gecko</li>
						 <li>how long you spend on each Gecko page</li>
						 <li>how you got to the site</li>
						 <li>what you click on while you’re visiting the site</li>
					</ul>
					<p>We also collect data in order to:</p>
					<ul>
						 <li>improve the site by monitoring how you use it</li>
						 <li>gather feedback to improve our services, for example our email alerts</li>
						 <li>respond to any feedback you send us, if you’ve asked us to</li>
						 <li>send email alerts and/or push notifications to users who request them</li>
						 <li>taylor news specific to you, for example based on your region</li>
					</ul>

			  <h2>What we do with your data</h2>
					<p>The data we collect may be shared with supplier organisations, other government departments, agencies and public bodies.</p>
					<p>We will not:</p>
					<ul>
						 <li>sell or rent your data to third parties</li>
						 <li>share your data with third parties for marketing purposes</li>
					</ul>
					<p>We will share your data if we are required to do so by law – for example, by court order, or to prevent fraud or other crime.</p>

			  <h2>How long we keep your data</h2>
					<p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as:</p>
					<ul>
						 <li>it is needed for the purposes set out in this document</li>
						 <li>the law requires us to</li>
					</ul>
					<p>In general, this means that we will only hold your personal data for a minimum of 1 year and a maximum of 7 years.</p>

			  <h2>Children’s privacy protection</h2>
					<p>Our services are not designed for, or intentionally targeted at, children 13 years of age or younger. We do not intentionally collect or maintain data about anyone under the age of 13.</p>

			  <h2>Where your data is processed and stored</h2>
					<p>Google's firebase is used, with both Gecko and Google making sure that your data is as safe as possible at any stage, both while it’s processed and when it’s stored.</p>
					<p>Your personal data may, throughout the course of its processing at Google, be transferred outside of the European Economic Area (EEA). Where this is the case, all appropriate technical and legal safeguards will be put in place to ensure that you are afforded the same level of protection as within the EEA.</p>

			  <h2>How we protect your data and keep it secure</h2>
					<p>We are committed to doing all that we can to keep your data secure. We have set up systems and processes to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure of your data – for example, we protect your data using varying levels of encryption.</p>
					<p>We also make sure that any third parties that we deal with keep all personal data they process on our behalf secure.</p>

			  <h2>Your rights</h2>
					<p>You have the right to request:</p>
					<ul>
						 <li>information about how your personal data is processed</li>
						 <li>a copy of that personal data</li>
						 <li>that anything inaccurate in your personal data is corrected immediately</li>
					</ul>
					<p>You can also:</p>
					<ul>
						 <li>raise an objection about how your personal data is processed</li>
						 <li>request that your personal data is erased if there is no longer a justification for it</li>
						 <li>ask that the processing of your personal data is restricted in certain circumstances</li>
					</ul>
					<p>If you have any of these requests, get in contact with our Data Protection Officer.</p>

			  <h2>Links to other websites</h2>
					<p>Gecko contains links to other websites.</p>
					<h4>Following a link to another website</h4>
						 <p>If you go to another website from this one, read the privacy policy on that website to find out what it does with your information.</p>
					<h4>Following a link to Gecko from another website</h4>
						 <p>If you come to Gecko from another website, we may receive information from the other website. We don’t use this data. You should read the privacy policy of the website you came from to find out more about this.</p>

			  <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
					<p>We may change this privacy policy. In that case, the ‘last updated’ date at the bottom of this page will also change. Any changes to this privacy policy will apply to you and your data immediately.</p>
					<p>If these changes affect how your personal data is processed, we will take reasonable steps to let you know.</p>
